## Theory background
### Triadic closure 
Triadic closure is a concept in social network theory, first suggested by German sociologist Georg Simmel in the early 1900s. Triadic closure is the property among three nodes A, B, and C, such that if a strong tie exists between A-B and A-C, there is a weak or strong tie between B-C.
